# Exercise 1
Build a "little" search engine that indexes and searches text files into a folder:

- Main class IndexSE takes the folder name where the documents are stored and the index directory name as argument (the class indexes all the ".txt" files into the folder);
- Main class SearchSE takes the index directory name and the query as arguments (the class searches the index).
